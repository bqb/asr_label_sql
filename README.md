# asr_label_sql
CCSF ASR requirements for map series labeling, positioned by PostGIS spatial SQL series

the need for labels was created by a specification from City and County of San Francisco (CCSF) Office of the Assessor-Recorder (ASR) to mimic existing graphic maps that were drafted and bound into Assesor books.  The labeling was reasonably concise and had been consistently viewable for decades through the flat-file products.
